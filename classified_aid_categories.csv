"On 23 October, the Council adopted a financial assistance package to Ukraine, including an exceptional macro-financial assistance (MFA) loan of up to 35 billion EUR and a loan cooperation mechanism that will support Ukraine in repaying loans for up to 45 billion EUR provided by the EU and G7 partners. The exceptional MFA will contribute to covering Ukraine´s financing gap, thereby supporting macro-financial stability in Ukraine and easing Ukraine´s external financial constraints. The exceptional MFA loan and eligible bilateral loans from G7 partners under the ‘Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) Loans for Ukraine' initiative will be repaid by future flows of extraordinary profits accruing to central securities depositories in the EU as a result of the implementation of the immobilisation of Russian sovereign assets. The up to €35 billion MFA loan is the EU's contribution to the G7 loan of up to €45 billion. The new MFA operation will be linked to policy conditions that are consistent with the Ukraine Facility. The MFA loan is expected to be made available to Ukraine before the end of 2024, to be disbursed by the end of 2025, and to have a maximum duration of 45 years (maturity).

Source of Aid 2 explains in more detail the plans for the Ukraine Facility that will be established and through which the EUR 50 billion will be allocated to provide short- and medium-term assistance to Ukraine. It mainly consists of three pillars. Pillar 1 (Ukraine Plan) sets to achieve social , econmonimc and environmental resilinece and reconstruction. Pillar 2 (Ukraine Investment Framework) consists of support to Ukraine “in the form of budgetary guarantee, financial instruments or blending operations” and Pillar 3 (Union accession assistance and support measures) should help alighn Ukraine to the EU for a possible future EU membership by strengthening the rule of law and democracy.
