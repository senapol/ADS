According to Source of Aid 2, the total amount allocated to civilian and humanitarian aid under the Nansen Support Program for 2024 is reported to be NOK 8.5 billion. On October 7, 2024, the Norwegian government proposed to increase the overall funding framework for the Nansen Support Programme for Ukraine to NOK 135 billion and to extend the Support Programme for an additional three years (until 2030). The 2024 allocations will increase from 22 billion NOK to 27 billion NOK (added 5 billion NOK). The new military aid committed will be 17 billion NOK (before it was 13.5 billion NOK), with an increase of 3.5  billion NOK; the new civilian aid committed will be 10 billion NOK (before it was 8.5 billion NOK). Therefore, we consider these 10 billion NOK as new civilian commitment for 2024.
