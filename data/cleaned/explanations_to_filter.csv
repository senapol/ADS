Australia contributed USD 3 million to NATO'S Trust Fund for Ukraine to support non-lethal military equipment and medical supplies.
"Australia has announced around 70 million AUD in lethal military assistance to support the defence of Ukraine, including missiles and weapons. They also provide a range of non-lethal military equipment and medical supplies in response to a specific request from the Ukrainian Government. No further information about the composition of the equipment was disclosed."
Additional 21 million AUD support package of defensive military assistance for the Ukrainian Armed Forces. No further information was disclosed.
"The government also announced A$8.7 million (US$6 million) to assist Ukraine’s Border Guard Service to upgrade border management equipment, improve cyber security and enhance border operations in the field."
"Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles declared that Australia will contribute AUD 20 million to NATO's Comprehensive Assistance Package Trust Fund, in addition to the AUD 4.2 million or USD  3 million."
"The Australian government will provide a  AUD 50 million grant to the International Fund for Ukraine, directly supporting the procurement of priority military capabilities."
"Lethal and non-lethal weapons amounting to 11 million EUR that were announced March 22 and April 4. This is not part of total aid until April 22 that is estimated by the Prime Minister to be 76 million EUR (""Source of Aid 2""). The package contains field beds, generators, heating systems, light weapons and ammunition, as well as ballistitc protection and night vision systems. The Belgium government disclosed further details on the content of the packages in January 2023 (Source of aid 1)."
"Belgium will send heavy machine guns, ammunition, and other equipment from Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal. It will also send non-lethal equipment for the winter, helmets, spare provisions and night vision equipment. In addition, ambulances and medical evacuation trucks are also expected to be delivered in early 2023. The Belgium government disclosed further details on the content of the package in January 2023 (Source of aid 4). Since the content of the packages reported in October 2022 corresponds to the current entry, we assume the size of the initial 12 EUR million package was extended later. It brings the total size of the package to 25 EUR million. Source of aid 3 specifies some of the in-kind donations as well as their quantity. For example, 120mm mortar is likely to be Mortar RTF1 (or MO-120 RT). "

Belgium will contribute 1.5 EUR million to the Comprehensive Assistance Package Ukraine (CAP) Trust Fund.
Belgium's 19th military support package for Ukraine for the amount of EUR 21 million. No further information is provided on the contents of the package.
"Belgium is setting up a EUR 1.760 billion Ukraine fund financed by frozen Russian assets in the country. Part of the EUR 1.505bn is earmarked for 2024 and EUR 225m for 2025. As the Belgian authorities have not disclosed how exactly the fund will be divided between military, financial and humanitarian aid, we assume that it will follow the distribution set in previous years."
"On 29 March 2024, the Council of Ministers approved an additional EUR 100 million towards the maintenance and support of Belgian F-16s destined to Ukraine."
"In a decision of the Council of Ministers of 26 April 2024 (Source 1), a new package of 204.3 million EUR in military support was allocated from the Ukraine Fund. This package includes support to the German initiative on Immediate Action on Air Defence (IAAD), and missiles for air defense systems drawn from stocks. The royal decree of 29 April 2024 (Source 2, p. 42-43) ratfies the allocation of the Ukraine Fund decided by the Council of Ministers on 26 April. In Source 3, Defence minister Dedonder specified that 200 million EUR of this package were allocated to the IAAD for the supply of anti-aircraft defense systems to Ukraine. This contribution to the IAAD was also referenced on page 4 of the Agreement on Security and Cooperation and Long Term Support between Belgium and Ukraine (Source 4). On this entry we report the allocation of  200 million EUR to the IAAD under the commitment on military aid made for 2024 (recorded on entry BEM 17)."

The rest is to be reported separately and not to be counted as total aid at this point. Due to rounding, funding to UNIFIER does not equal the sum of the funding for each FY (1 million is omitted). Therefore, we assign 1/3 of a million for each FY."

"Grant amounting to 1 million CAD, which can be used for the purchase of commercial satellite high resolution and modern imagery. ""Source of Aid 1"" lists a shipment of 4500 M72 rocket launchers as well as 7500 hand grenades, these are included in aid package CAM5, 25 million CAD in non-lethal weapons, reported in CAM4 and lethal and non-lethal equipment reported in CAM3. According to the Overview page for Canadian military aid (Source for Delivery), this aid has been delivered."
"On March 9, the Canadian prime Minister announced that Canada would provide an additional $50 million in lethal and non-lethal military equipment to Ukraine (Source of aid 1). Since no weapons were attached to this particular donation, we include the following weapons donation as a part of this package."
"On April 7, it was announced that Canada also allocated $500 million in additional military aid for Ukraine for the 2022-23 fiscal year. Since no weapons were attached to this particular donation, we include the following weapons donation as a part of this package."
"Canada will provide approximately 34 CAD million in additional military aid to Ukraine. Canada will use 5 CAD million of the said funds to provide the Armed Forces with modern satellite imagery, 18 CAD million for high-resolution cameras for unmanned aerial vehicles, and the remaining 10 CAD million for winter gear, including portable heaters, blankets, and sleeping bags."
"Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mélanie Joly, announced more than $32 million in support of security and stabilization in the country. This includes contributions to demining and accountability efforts, as well as countering chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats that jeopardize the safety of the entire region."
"On April 11, 2023, Canada announced it would donate additional small arms and ammunition to Ukraine, sourced from Colt Canada, valued at approximately 59 CAD million. This package includes 21,000 5.56mm assault rifles, 38 7.62mm machine guns, over 2.4 million rounds of ammunition to support these weapons, and small arms already in use by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Accessories and spares for these small arms are also included in this package. Delivery was performed in two tranches. In the first batch, 100 thousand rounds of ammunition, a total amount of Leopard ammunition, and 21 thousand Colts were delivered. The second batch had the rest."
"At the meeting with the Ukraine Defense Contact Group on April 21, 2023, Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand announced that Canada will donate 34.6 CAD million to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Ukraine Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) Trust Fund."
"The Prime Minister announced a 500 CAD million package of military aid (Source of aid 1). Later, the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine thanked Canadian Senate for this donation, confirming it officially. We assume that in July, during the NATO summit in Vilnius, the Prime Minister announced the same donation since he mentioned that it was an additional 8 CAD billion provided before, which is precisely Canadian assistance prior to the first announcement of the current 500 CAD package (Source of aid 3). Since part of this package goes to support the Leopard 2 Tank Maintenance Centre in Poland, which we do not count as bilateral aid, we report only 470 CAD million here (Source of aid 4)."
"Canada will contribute 33 CAD million to a UK-led air defence equipment partnership. This donation is funded as part of the 500 CAD million in new funding for military assistance for Ukraine in Kyiv, Ukraine, by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in June 2023."
"The Prime Minister announced 48.8 CAD million to the CAP Trust Fund for Ukraine, supporting NATO’s provision of non-lethal practical assistance and defense capacity building through donations of materials, including fuel, bridging equipment, rations, and first aid. Since the next donation is done using the funds from the package announced in June 2023 (Source of aid), we assume that his donations was also financed by the same means."
"In November 2023, Canada released a budget for the current fiscal year 2023-2024. The budget unveiled that Canada allocated a total of 816 CAD for military aid to Ukraine in 2023. As our dataset has already recorded the same amount, we are reporting 0 here."
"The 2024-2025 Military Aid Plan: In November 2023, Canada released a budget covering the current fiscal year 2023-2024 and the subsequent two fiscal years. The budget revealed that Canada is set to allocate 318 million CAD for military aid to Ukraine in the 2024-2025 fiscal year and 197 million CAD in the 2025-2026 fiscal year."
"On the Canadian overview page, total military aid reached CAD 4 billion (source of aid 1). Since they previously reported 2.6 billion CAD (Source of Aid 2), we assume that 1.6 billion is the budget for FY 2024-2025. However, our dataset already records around CAD 300 million from budget planning instruments for the same fiscal year. We therefore report the difference here. Later, in the budget for FY2024-2025, it was specified that 1.6 billion would not be provided in FY2024-2025, but would be spread evenly over the next five FYs (Source of Aid 3, p.342).  Therefore, we only show the difference of CAD 2 million here and distrubute the rest to the following years. "
"In Source 1, the Department of Defence announced a donation of CAD 3 million to Ukraine for the production of drones by Ukraine’s domestic defence industry. This donation is  funded by the CAD 500 million military assistance package commited on June 12, 2023 (Source 2)."
"In Source 1, the Department of Defence announced a  CAD 76 million contribution to Germany’s Immediate Action on Air Defence initiative (IAAD) for  sourcing and delivering air defence systems for Ukraine. The Canadain overview page (Source 2) reiterates this allocation. According to Source 3, this CAD 76 million comes from the CAD 1.6 billion in military aid over five years previously announced in the federal budget. Accordingly, this allocation is reported under the military aid commited for 2024-2025 (recorded in entry CAM27)."
"At a meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council on July 11, 2024, the Prime Minister Trudeau announced that Canada will provide an additional military aid to Ukraine (Source 1). Another announcement by Minister of National Defense (Source 2)  detailed this new commitment further, revealing that Canada will provide an additional $500 million in military assistance as part of NATO’s pledge of long-term security assistance for Ukraine. This includes almost $444 million to Canada’s Department of National Defence to support the costs of military equipment, assistance, and training for Ukraine’s Armed Forces as well as over $56 million for the NATO Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) Trust Fund for Ukraine to help rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector and advance Ukraine’s transition toward full interoperability with NATO.  These funds will be provided in addition to military assistance that Canada has already pledged. "
"At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Defence Ministers’ meeting in Brussels, the Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of National Defence, announced $64.8 million in military assistance to Ukraine.

Canada has also committed 5 million CAD towards the Drone Capability Coalition Common Fund to support Ukraine’s drone industry and procure drones that are crucial to Ukraine’s defence efforts. In addition, 2 million CAD are donated to join the IT Capability Coalition and continue Canada’s role in working with Ukraine to strengthen its cyber capabilities, and 10.5 million CAD are donated for training. This last 10.5 million CAD are not coded since we do not count aid for training. The donations announced today are part of an additional 500 million CAD in military assistance to Ukraine, announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the NATO Summit in July 2024. This entry records the funds for the IT Coalition."

"According to Source of Aid 1, the government aid to Ukraine has been in total EUR160 million, of which 77% (EUR123 million) is estimated to be military aid (Source of Aid 2). We use this figure, EUR123 million, to benchmark and subtract the values of HRM1 and HRM2 to arrive at EUR44,562,710 "

"Croatian Minister of Foreign and European Affairs states that Croatia has sent a total of 190 million EUR to Ukraine. He says that Croatia has given all forms of aid, ""not only humanitarian, not only political and diplomatic, but also military"" (Source of Aid 1). Therefore, we use this value to benchmark our values. To date, we have recorded 130,457,970 EUR of Croatian aid. The amount of aid we have not yet accounted for is 59,542,030 EUR. Finding no information about the this aid has been split between the aid types, we split it equally. We attribute 29,771,015 to humanitarian aid (entry HRH7) and to military aid (HRM6).   "
"Croatian Minister of Foreign and European Affairs states that Croatia has sent a total of 230 million EUR to Ukraine. He further states that EUR 50 million of the EUR 230 million went to ""urgent, humanitarian and technical assistance"". We assume that the remaining EUR 180 million went to military aid. Until now, we have only recorded EUR 151.782.620 of military aid. The amount we have not yet accounted for is thus EUR 28.217.380. We attribute the EUR 28.217.380 to military aid in entry HRM6. Source of aid 2 specified that until August 2023, Croatia provided 160 EUR million of military aid, meaning that including this donation, the total amount should be 160 EUR million. We use this information to correct our estimations for military aid. Therefore, humanitarian aid provided to this date should be 230 - 160 = 70 EUR million.  "
Croatian Prime Minister announced an additional EUR30 million military aid package to Ukraine on Thursday's agenda of the Government session. Source of aid 2 confirms that this donation was confirmed during the closed part of the Government session.

"The Czech Ministry of Defense declared that Czechia will send in between 26 and 30 million USD  in additional in-kind military aid to Ukraine. The 150 million USD mentioned in ""Source of Aid 1"" are covered in CZM1-CZM15. We do not consider the CZM16 being part of the 150 million USD mentioned in ""Source of Aid 1"", since it is only a commitment, whereas the source explicitly refers to the monetary value of the deliveries. No detail regarding the items was revealed."
"Czechia approved a new batch of military aid to Ukraine with equipment, weapons, and ammunition. The package includes heavy equipment, short-barreled and long-barreled weapons, as well as ammunition, but further details of the deal are not being disclosed in Czechia for security reasons. According to Source of Aid 2, the value of the package is 400 million CZK. According Source of Aid 3 and delivery source, the following items have been sent to Ukraine in 2022.

"US and Netherlands partner to refurbish 90 Czech T-72 tanks to be sent to Ukraine. The refurbishment project costs a total of 90 million USD, which means it costs 1 million USD per tank. Source of Aid 4 states that these tanks are not from the Czech army, but from industry stocks. This means Czechia does not provide direct bilateral aid to Ukraine in this package, which is why we do not count any value for it here. We still list this entry to allow cross-referencing with the Dutch and US entries."
The Czech government plans to provide training to up to 4000 Ukrainian troops. The training will cost 975 million crowns.
"The Czech government stated that the country has supplied material and training worth roughly 10 billion CZK, as of 23 February. We compare this value to the sum of the values from CZM1-24 using exchange rate 1 EUR = 23.89 CZK for EUR entries, which is 12,129,796,699 CZK. Since this comes relatively close to the ""roughly 10 billion CZK"" indicated by the government and we want do avoid underestimation, we keep our values to this date."

"On December 21, a new announcement by the Danish Defence Minister stated that DKK 300 million (EUR 42.8 million) would be given as further military aid to Ukraine. The money will be donated via the UK-led International Fund for Ukraine, which is used to provide military equipment and other support to Ukraine's armed forces. This is in accordance with the Danish aid overview page (Source of Aid 2), which displays the Danish military contribution as EUR 565 million in December. Source of aid 3 published in March 2023 specified that Denmark provided 370 DKK million, and we, therefore, changed it to 370 DKK."

Later it was specified that the Netherlands increased its donation to Ukraine Comprehensive Assistance Package (UCAP) by 5 EUR million (Source of aid 3)."
"According to the letter to the official website, the Netherlands provided 987 million EUR of military aid until December 16 (Source of aid 1). This includes the 120 million package that includes T-72 mentioned in NLM7. Since our dataset only recorded less until this date, we report the rest here. "
"According to the letter on the official website, the Netherlands provided 1.07 billion EUR of military aid until January 24 (Source of aid 1). Since the first military aid package in 2023 was only announced on January 20, 2023, we assume that the difference from the previous announcement was not financed by funds for 2023. Therefore, we report it separately and do not include as a part of 2023 package."
"The Dutch Cabinet approved the proposal by ministers Liesje Schreinemacher (Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation), Wopke Hoekstra (Foreign Affairs), Kajsa Ollongren (Defense), and Sigrid Kaag (Finance) to earmark EUR 2.5 billion for support to Ukraine in 2023 (Source of aid 1,2). This amount excludes liquidity support going through the EU and support for the reception of Ukrainians in the Netherlands (Source of aid 2). Since we did not know which part goes to which type of aid, we assumed that it will follow the pattern of Dutch assistance in 2022, and therefore, 60% goes to military aid, 25% goes to financial aid, and 15% goes to humanitarian aid. Thus, we assigned 1.5 billion to military aid in 2023. Source of aid 3 stated that up to December 16, 2023, NL provided 2.63 billion EUR of military aid. Since we did not include the military aid delivered between December 16, 2022, and January 24, 2023, we assume that the total aid provided (and therefore, dedicated) in 2023 is the difference between the value reported in Source of aid 3 and Source of aid 4, which is 2.63 billion EUR minus 1.07 billion EUR. Therefore, the total aid planned to be provided in 2023 is estimated to be 1.56 EUR billion, which is close to the initially assumed 1.5 EUR billion."
"According to Source of Aid 1, the Netherlands contributes EUR 100 million to the NATO CAP. We currently list EUR 25 million, so here we report the remaining EUR 75 million."
The Netherlands announced a contribution of EUR 40 million to purchase air defence assets in a multilateral partnership.
"As we have not included the military aid delivered between 16 December 2022 and 24 January 2023, we assume that the total aid delivered (and therefore earmarked) in 2023 is the difference between the value reported in Source 1 and Source 2, i.e. EUR 2.63 billion minus EUR 1.07 billion. Therefore, the total aid planned to be granted in 2023 is estimated at EUR 1.56 billion, which is close to the initially assumed EUR 1.5 billion. As our allocations have been lower so far, we report the difference here."
"For 2024, the government of the Netherlands has set aside over 2 EUR billion in aid. Most of it is intended for military aid; however, some funds will be allocated for humanitarian and financial aid.
